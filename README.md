*Project Name: Hand-gesture Volume Control**

**Description**

This project enables you to control your system volume using hand gestures captured by your webcam. It leverages the power of OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection.

**Features**

- Intuitive volume control through hand gestures
- Visual feedback with a volume bar and percentage display
- Real-time volume adjustments based on finger and thumb distance

**Requirements**

- Python 3.x (tested with 3.7+)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- pycaw (`pip install pycaw`)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control.git`.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw`

**Usage**

1. Run the script using `python main.py`.
2. Open your webcam and start using hand gestures to control the volume.
   - Move your index finger and thumb closer to increase volume.
   - Move them further apart to decrease volume.

**Code Structure**

```
hand_gesture_volume_control/
├── main.py             # Main script for volume control with hand gestures
├── HandTrackingModule.py  # (Optional) Custom module for hand detection (not provided)
```

**Explanation**

**main.py:**

- Imports necessary libraries.
- Sets up camera resolution and video capture object.
- Initializes audio endpoint volume control.
- Enters a loop that continuously reads frames from the camera.
- Uses `HandTrackingModule` (or a similar hand detection method) to find hands in the frame.
- If a hand is detected:
   - Calculates the distance between the index finger and thumb based on landmark positions.
   - Maps the distance to a volume level and sets the system volume using `pycaw`.
   - Updates the volume bar and percentage display on the screen.
- Displays the frame with FPS information.
